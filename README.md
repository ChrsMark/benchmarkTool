# Benchmarking tool for Elasticsearch

This repository holds configuration files and code for the benchmarking tool application. Using this application we can test our Elasticsearch cluster on our demand.

The application consists of two parts. Read module and write module. With read module we can test reading operations on a spcified rate(see conf file) and with write we can insert artificial data into the cluster.
 

This project is part of my Diploma Thesis on [*CSLab Ntua*](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/)
